## Assignment 1,2
```{r}
library(network)
drugpaj <- read.paj('drugnet2.paj')
drug <- drugpaj$networks[[1]] # Extract network
plot(drug)
#check what attributes we have and lets extract them
names(drugpaj$partitions)
gender <- drugpaj$partitions[[1]]
ethnicity <- drugpaj$partitions[[2]]
drug <-set.vertex.attribute(drug, 'gender', value=c(gender))
drug <-set.vertex.attribute(drug, 'ethnicity', value=c(ethnicity))
gender <- drugpaj$partitions[[1]]
colors1 <- ifelse(gender == 1,'cadetblue' , ifelse(gender == 2, 'indianred', 'grey'))
plot(drug, vertex.col = colors1)

colors2 <- ifelse(ethnicity ==1,'grey' , ifelse(ethnicity == 2, 'indianred', ifelse(ethnicity == 0,'green','cadetblue')))
plot(drug, vertex.col = colors2)

```
As a result we see that men are more prone to be in the center of the network.
And what is more interesting people of one ethnicity are more prone to have deals with their ethnicity. There are 2 big clusters, and both of them have ethnicity majority, but ethnicity are different.

## Assignment 3

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
